Genetic Algorithm for Travelling Salesman Problem
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm-based solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) in C. The goal is to find the most efficient route that visits each city once and returns to the starting city, optimizing route planning and resource allocation.

Features
Random Array Generation: Generates a population of random routes.
Crossover: Combines pairs of routes to produce new routes.
Mutation: Introduces small changes to routes to maintain genetic diversity.
Optimal Route Selection: Evaluates and selects the shortest route from the population.
